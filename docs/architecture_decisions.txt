the API project, is broken down to 5 microservices : 

- location-storage-writer gRPC API, accept the location request and push it to Kafka 
- location-storage-consumer a listener to create topic, and once recieving an input will insert it to database 
- location-storage-service a RESTFUL API for location queries 
- person-storage-writer a RESTFUL API for person creation
- person-storage-service a RESTFUL API for person queries, and connections retrieval

for enhancing the connection long process, it's an open question :
	* use cache to cache the frequently used data, like the connection we can Use Redis for example 
	* not create person memorycache everytime, maybe in frequent time
